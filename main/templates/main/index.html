        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Click the button below</b><br>
            This takes you to Open Humans authentification page.</li>
          <li><b>Log in or create an Open Humans account</b><br>
            Your Moves data will be added to this account.</li>
          <li><b>Authorize this app in Open Humans</b><br>
            This authorizes us to add your Moves data to your account.</li>
          <li><b>Authorize us to access your Moves account.</b><br>
            The Open Humans website will redirect you back to us for the last
            step: Authorizing us to access your <i>Moves</i> account. It will take you to the Moves website where a <i>PIN</i> will be displayed.
          </li>
          <li><b>Enter your PIN.</b><br>
            Enter the PIN the Moves website displays
            in your Moves phone application. You are all set now!

        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Will my data from Moves be public?</b><br>
            <b>The short answer</b>: No, by connecting your Moves account you don't agree
            to make your data public or give anyone access to this data.
            It will be stored in your account and you decide with whom to share.<br>
            <b>The longer answer</b>: It can be public if you want it to be public.
            If you're logged in into Open Humans <a href='https://www.openhumans.org/public-data/'>
              can make individual sources publicly available
            through the public data feature</a>.
          </li>
          <li><b>Do you keep my data up to date?</b><br>
            Yes, we regularly update your data to keep it up to date.
          After logging in you can also manually trigger an update.</li>
          <li><b>Who's running this project?</b><br>
            This project is run by the team of Open Humans itself.</li>
          <li><b>How can I be in touch with you?</b><br>
